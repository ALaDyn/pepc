TODO-List for pepc-newstruct (partially also mentioned in code)
===============================================================

- split datatypes into t_leaf and t_twig. Then, every twig should be able to contain a number of sub-twigs and/or leaves. 
    --> leaves may have particle properties e.g. label, which do not make sense for twigs (and the other way round, e.g. childcode) 
    --> perform walk for all leaves below a some twig instead of particles

- make checkpointing-stuff independet of t_particle_data type

- fix pepc_fields_grid which is currently nonfunctional

- make all particle numbers, leaves, etc integer*8 to support >2000000000particles

- put weighted and curve_type into cf_par

- remove mac.f90

- build infrastructure for additional parallelization approaches (SMPSs etc.)

- add bitmap for htable occupancy instead of clearing the complete htable in each timestep

- find good estimation for nppmax or make it adjustable by the user

- think about calc_force_per_particle - does it really have to be called from module_pepcfields --> possibly call it from the frontend directly

- remove further variables from treevars (e.g. tree_nodes --> module_tree)

- include HAns Peschke's work on hierarchical parallel tree construction

- see TODO's in code

- see SmallProjects and PUDG reports in wiki
