# PEPC - the Pretty Efficient Parallel Coulomb solver

## Continuous benchmarking

After successful builds on one of JSC's HPC systems, PEPC's CI will perform a
consistency check and if again successful a short performance run on the same
system. Results from those will be stored in the repository for analysis. Every
branch with data available will be listed in the navigation on the left and the
links can be used to display results for PEPC's continuous benchmarking.
