<hr>

PEPC - Pretty Efficient Parallel Coulomb-solver - is a parallel tree-code 
for rapid computation of long-range Coulomb forces in N-body particle systems. Based on the original
Barnes-Hut algorithm, the code uses successively larger
multipole-groupings of distant particles to reduce the computational
effort in the force calculation from the generally
unaffordable O(N<sup>2</sup>) operations needed for brute-force summation, to a
more amenable O(N log N) complexity.
The parallel version is a pure MPI implementation of the Warren-Salmon
'Hashed Oct Tree' scheme, including several different variations of
the tree traversal routine - the most challenging component in terms
of scalability.

<p>


The public version is divided into kernel routines and 'front-end'
applications, which currently include a skeleton molecular dynamics
program (<b> PEPC-E</b>), and a code for simulating laser- or
beam-plasma interactions (<b> PEPC-B</b>).   There is also a (non-public)
gravitational version (<b> PEGS</b>) for modelling astrophysical
discs, developed in collaboration with the <a href="http://www.ph1.uni-koeln.de/pfalzner">University of Cologne</a>.


<p>
 
The code currently runs on IBM Regatta, BlueGene/L and standard Linux
clusters, but should be portable to any Unix-based parallel
architecture.  The <a href="doc/pepc_ug.pdf"> User Guide</a> provides an introduction to compiling
and running the code.
