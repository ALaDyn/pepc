------------------------------------------------------------------------


1.3 -> 1.4   (May 2006)
=======================

Revisions 337-485

Added xy proton plots
Included proton density, temp, phase space, spectrum
Created new post-proc script for 3-species config
Added vec field selection

New configs (beam_config) for constant B-field:

i) Bz        (7)
ii) Z-pinch (17)
iii) 'tokamak' (27)
iv) magnetic mirror (37)

Updated visit library paths
Removed emobliq case (7=>24)

Logical error in tree_walk fixed - acceptance of leaf nodes didn't correctly exclude self-term via ignore flag (was excluded anyway with s/d mac), leading to potential errors for other macs.

Last 2 cols (Tpon, xc) of energy.dat removed 

Tree diagnostic calls placed at top to avoid clash with sum_fields, radial_fields where intlist reused for computing pot, fields on grid.

Error found & fixed in potential (Falk Eilenberger):
Cross-terms of quadrupole had wrong sign!
Now fixed so that notation & signs consistent with P&G, page 28-29 and 
p.138 of Jackson.
RMS error in potential now smaller than force error (as expected).

Added case 6 to special configs: 
Sets up microscopic (Debye) system in cubic box, length xl.  Force const derived from equivalent Gamma.

Added plasma config #21: mixed species can (50:50)
Made maxleaf, maxtwig global

New config: shell + proton disc
New plasma config: inset target for RAL focussing studies

New geometries + relabelling (target_geometry)
Added: 12 - tube
	13 - hollow wire
	26, 36 - reversed hemisphere/ hollow hemisph.
Hollow sphere changed from 6 to 11
For each new geometry, need changes in:
face, configure (laser focus), plasma_start and vis_config.F90

Added new geometry 16 - flipped hemisphere.  Affects routines face, plasma_start, configure

New vis routine for interactive configuration mode

Added hexdecode to bin scripts; modified directory copy to include .bgl scripts

walk_scheme option added
Timing breakdown for build into tree-build, branches & fill
Updated configure with APLR's doped target configs

pegs subproject created 
------------------------
Accelerations changed to ex,ey,ez in velocities
Fixed alloc in setup; removed setup_arrays - now in pepc_setup; fixed timings, I/O

key2addr_db replaced by key2addr including call location
Rearranged setup structure: now separate routines for particle & star data
Changed paths for slicer packs added, subdirs to tutorial, pegs setup fixed
Added vis_vecfields for xnbody - electron current
Added pegs to pepc repository

Alex Robinson (RAL): Added new plasma_config=12 for double-sided proton layer

Recursive sort routine psbal added to tree_utils
Uses successive key refinements to ensure uniform bin distribution
before placing pivots

	walk_scheme introduced to switch between asynch, collective walks
	mac now represents MAC - clumping switch

New NETCDF fields

Added proton disc config
Added config routine for tapered spherical density profile
Fixed split force routine - separate monopole/multipole terms
Proton layer config front/back; fixed labelling for parallel run
MAC modified to exclude root node for dummy particle lists in vacuum
Radial field computed using tree sum_force
Added sum_radial



1.2 -> 1.3   (Jan 2006)
=======================

Laser-plasma front end:
----------------------

* Reorganised plasma configuration/setup:

	randion.f90 replaced by encapsulated plasma_start.f90 to allow more
	flexible configs: multiple geometries, Z>1, mixed species in configure.f90.
	Velocities now specified with velocity_config (cold, Maxwellian or beam).
	Removed redundant double_target.f90 - can now do this in configure routine
	Proton layer config front/back; fixed labelling for parallel run

* Added field diagnostic for radially symmetric case
* Fixed error in linear particle->grid weighting (density gather) (weights f1, f2 were wrong way round!).

lpepc kernel:
------------

* MAC modified to exclude root node for dummy particle lists in vacuum
* Adjustments to LJ pot - clamp max accn
* Replaced pack function in tree_aswalk; tidied up arrays
* Fixed bug in sort routine (upper fencepost); array adjustments 


1.1 -> 1.2  (Nov 2005)
======================

Removed automatic promotion of single-precision reals (REAL*4) to doubles (REAL*8) by compiler.
On some compilers this was overriding deliberate REAL*4 definitions needed for passing data to 
visualisation interface (nbody3).
