1.1 -> 1.2  (Nov 2005)
==========

Removed automatic promotion of single-precision reals (REAL*4) to doubles (REAL*8) by compiler.
On some compilers this was overriding deliberate REAL*4 definitions needed for passing data to 
visualisation interface (nbody3). 

1.2 -> 1.3   (Jan 2006)
==========

Laser-plasma front end:
----------------------
* Reorganised plasma configuration/setup:

	randion.f90 replaced by encapsulated plasma_start.f90 to allow more
	flexible configs: multiple geometries, Z>1, mixed species in configure.f90.
	Velocities now specified with velocity_config (cold, Maxwellian or beam).
	Removed redundant double_target.f90 - can now do this in configure routine
	Proton layer config front/back; fixed labelling for parallel run

* Added field diagnostic for radially symmetric case
	
* Fixed error in linear particle->grid weighting (density gather) (weights f1, f2 were wrong way round!).

lpepc kernel:
-----------

* MAC modified to exclude root node for dummy particle lists in vacuum

* Adjustments to LJ pot - clamp max accn

* Replaced pack function in tree_aswalk; tidied up arrays

* Fixed bug in sort routine (upper fencepost); array adjustments
