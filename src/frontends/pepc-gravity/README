This frontend simulates bodies (particles) moving under the gravitational force. 
The initial particles can be read from an input file or can be generated
by the Plummer model provided herein. See comments of read_particles() for file
format description if you want to use your own data file.

The frontend is adapted from pepc-mini, which does Coulombic froce simulation.
To make the code change minimal, I use charge(i.e., the q field) of particles 
in pepc-mini to represent mass of particles in pepc-gravity. 

The interaction specific backend (src/interaction_specific/gravity/) uses
monopole instead of multipole. But it should be easy to change it to multipole.

In all, pepc-gravity tries to mimic the Stanford SPLASH-2 Barnes-Hut code as close
as possible, so one can compare them.
