This directory contains a copy of the OpenPA (Open Portable Atomics) library
[1]. Atomic operations are used in PEPC as a lightweight alternative to locks 
for thread synchronization. The content of each entry in this directory is as
follows:

  - README: This text
  - atomic_ops.c: A thin wrapper around a subset of OpenPA functions similar to
                  src/treecode/pthreads/pthreads_c.c
  - module_atomic_ops.f90: Fortran bindings for the functions defined in
                           atomic_ops.c
  - makefile: Instructions for the PEPC build system to build OpenPA itself and
              copy the results to lib/, similar to the sorting library. This
              makefile is run by its own make process.
  - makefile.include: Instructions for the PEPC build system to include the
                      OpenPA wrappers and bindings in atomic_ops.c and
                      module_atomic_ops.f90 into the regular PEPC build. This
                      makefile is included into the main build makefile.
  - openpa: The OpenPA library distribution as found at [1]
