# 1. REQUIREMENTS

- A reasonably modern Fortran compiler with support for Fortran 2003 object
  orientation, e.g.:
   * GCC >= 4.6
   * Intel >= 12.1
   * IBM XL Fortran >= 12
- A C compiler and a C preprocessor with support for variadic macros.
- An MPI library with support for MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE. PEPC will complain
  about missing support at run time.
- Support for POSIX threads (pthreads).


# 2. COMPILATION

For compiling this program, the machine-dependent compiler names and flags have
to be set in a definition file called `makefile.defs` in the root directory.

Several exemplary definitions are available in the subdirectory `./makefiles`.
For example, for GCC you can simply run
```sh
ln -sf ./makefiles/makefile.defs.GCC ./makefile.defs
```
from the root directory to create a symbolic link the the appropriate
definitions. Some compiler or machine specific hints are contained in the files
within this directory, please have look there.

After providing the makefile.defs file, you can simply call
```
make help
```
to show information/recommendation on machine specifics.

After setting the proper environment (modules, paths) call
```sh
make pepc-mini
```
to build the `pepc-mini` frontend into the `./bin/` directory. Parallel make
(i.e. `make -j <n>`) should work.

There are several different frontends available at the moment:

- `pepc-b`:  
laser/beam-plasma with magnetic fields  
- `pepc-essential`/`pepc-benchmark`:  
simple setup w/ a Coulomb explosion  
also used for benchmarking  
- `pepc-darwin-2d`:  
2D version w/ Darwin appoximation for electrodynamics
- `pepc-mini`:  
pure electrostatics  
simple molecular dynamics  
no diagnostics  
*minimum requirements to get `PEPC` running*  
- `pepc-neighbour`:  
tree-based nearest neighbour search  
- `pepc-kh`, `pepc-kh-essential`:  
Kevin-Helmholtz setup (`essential` following text-books)
- `pepc-v`:  
vortex dynamics using the vortex particle method  

To build an alternative frontend, just call
```sh
make pepc-essential
```
or
```sh
make pepc-benchmark
```

All frontends can be built using 
```sh
make (-j <n>) all
```

At the current stage, there is no real documentation available for the different
frontends. However, you might simply want to take a look at the respective
sourcecode to find out what they are doing.


# 3. RUNNING THE PROGRAM

Usually, the frontend's source directories contain a sample input deck for the
frontends. For running `pepc-essential` it is for example called `params`. It
contains user-adjustable parameters and can be fed to the executable as first
command line parameter:
```sh
cd bin
mpirun -np 32 pepc-essential ../src/frontends/pepc/essential/params
```


# 4. DOCUMENTATION

Rudimentary doxygen documentation is available by calling
```sh
make doc
```
from the root directory. A users guide is in preparation. 


# 5. REPORTING PROBLEMS

Please submit an issue with PEPC's issue tracker if you encounter a problem.
There are a number of templates available depending on the problem you want to
report:
- General problems use the [default template](https://gitlab.jsc.fz-juelich.de/SLPP/pepc/pepc/-/issues/new)
- Questions on how to [use PEPC](https://gitlab.jsc.fz-juelich.de/SLPP/pepc/pepc/-/issues/new?issuable_template=PEPC%20usage)
- Problems with a particular [frontend](https://gitlab.jsc.fz-juelich.de/SLPP/pepc/pepc/-/issues/new?issuable_template=frontend)
- Putting in a [feature requests](https://gitlab.jsc.fz-juelich.de/SLPP/pepc/pepc/-/issues/new?issuable_template=feature-request)

Please note that our rescources are limited and that we will prioritise any
requests. We do, however, appreciate any contribution.


# 6. DIRECTORY STRUCTURE / ADDING OWN FUNCTIONALITY

Inside the `./src/` directory, you will find four subdirectories:
- "treecode": PEPC kernel, everything that is necessary for the pure
  algorithmic part of the treecode
- "interaction_specific": interaction specific backends. The different
  subdirectories herein (currently mainly: coulomb, darwin, and vortex)
  provide data structures and functions for the different applications. See
  inline documentation in the sourcecode (especially inside the coulomb-subdir,
  which should be well documented) to find out about what the functions should
  do and which of them are necessary. The only files that must be provided in
  this directory are (names may not be changed, public functions and
  datastructures inside these files are mandatory):
  * `module_interaction_specific.f90`: data structures and functions for
     manipulating them
  * `module_calc_force.f90`: functions for actual force-law and multipole
     acceptance criterion etc.
  * `makefile.backend`: backend specific modifications to treecode makefile,
     may be empty
- "utils": source code of utilities (mainly for treecode diagnostics,
  vtk-output etc.)
- "frontends": different applications that utilize the treecode for their
  respective very specific purpose. The file `makefile.frontend` configures
  which source files, interaction ("BACKEND" / "BACKENDTYPE"), and tree walk
  ("WALK") will be included/used.

In case you want to use PEPC for developing a treecode-based N-body code, you
might start by copying and modifying the `pepc-mini` frontend, which is a very
simple coulomb-MD programme. It uses the coulomb backend, that implements an
expansion of the plummer potential 1/sqrt(r^2+eps^2) up to quadrupole order.

Take care that your frontend-directory is called "pepc-something" with no
further minus sign ("-") to be automatically recognized in the build system.

If you want to provide a new interaction-specific backend (for using other
multipole orders and/or force laws), just copy and modify the coulomb
subdirectory there. The backends do not have to be registered in some makefile,
but are selected inside the `makefile.frontend` and later included by the main
makefile. In case you only need to modify the interaction specific types but
not the functions that are dealing with them (for example for adding velocity,
mass, etc.), take a look at the coulomb-backend how to adjust the "type".
There, this is done for the `pepc-mini` frontend, that uses other types than
for example `pepc-b` while still using the same force expression. See
also variable "BACKENDTYPE" in `pepc-mini`'s `makefile.include`.
