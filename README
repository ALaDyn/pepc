============================================================

1. COMPILATION

For compiling this program, the machine-dependent compiler 
names and flags have to be set in a definition file called
'makefile.defs' in the root directory.

Several exemplary definitions are available in the subdirectory
./makefiles. For example, an JUGENE you can simply call

"ln -sf ./makefiles/makefile.defs.jugene ./makefile.defs"

from the root directory to create a symbolic link the the 
appropriate definitions. Some makefile.defs contain
comments on correct MPI implementations etc. - do not
forget to take a look there for hints.

After providing the makefile.defs file, you can simply
call 

"make help"

to show information/recommendation on machine specifics.

After setting the proper environment (modules, paths) 
call 

"make pepc-e"

to build the pepce frontend into the ./bin/ directory. 
Parallel make (i.e. "make -j") should work.

There are several different frontends available at the moment:

pepc-b:    Laser/beam-plasma with magnetic fields
pepc-e:    pure electrostatics
             simple molecular dynamics, 
             some diagnostics for energy, performance, vtk output etc.
pepc-mini: pure electrostatics
             simple molecular dynamics
             no diagnostics
             minimum requirements to get pepc running
pepc-mw:   frontend for laser-plasma interaction (experimental)
pepc-s:    library version for inclusion in ScaFaCoS project
pepc-nn:   tree-based nearest neighbour search
pepc-sph:  gravitation and smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph)
           for astrophysics research (experimental)
pepc-v:    vortex dynamics using the vortex particle method

To build an alternative frontend, just call

"make pepc-mini"
or
"make pepc-mw"

All frontends can be built using 

"make (-j) all"

At the current stage, there is no real documentation available for the
different frontends. However, you might simply want to take a look at 
the respective sourcecode to find out what they are doing.


============================================================

2. RUNNING THE PROGRAM

Create a run directory, and copy the file run.h there.
Then you can run pepc from there, e.g.

"mkdir rundir"
"cp run.h rundir/"
"cd rundir"
"mpirun -np 4 ../bin/pepc-e ./run.h"

The file run.h contains some user-adjustable parameters which
are explained therein.

If you want to use checkpointing, particle data output and
vtk file creation (see idump_XXX-parameters for details), 
you will find the output in two additional directories 
inside rundir that are created automatically:

"vtk"
"particles"


============================================================

3. DOCUMENTATION

Rudimentary doxygen documentation is available by calling

"make doc"

from the root directory. A users guide is in preparation. 


============================================================

4. DIRECTORY STRUCTURE / ADDING OWN FUNCTIONALITY

Inside the ./src/ directory, you will find four subdirectories:
 - treecode: PEPC kernel, everything that is necessary for
             the pure algorithmic part of the treecode
 - interaction_specific: interaction specific backends. The different
             subdirectories herein (currently: coulomb, vortex, and
             nearestneighbour) provide data structures and functions
             for the different applications. See inline documentation
             in the sourcecode (especially inside the coulomb-subdir,
             which should be well documented) to finc out about what the
             functions should do and which of them are necessary.
             The only files that must be provided in this directory are
             (names may not be changed, public functions and datastructures 
             inside these files are mandatory):
              - module_interaction_specific.f90: data structures and functions
                  for manipulating them
              - module_calc_force.f90: functions for actual force-law and
                  multipole acceptance criterion etc.
              - makefile.backend: backend specific modifications to
                  treecode makefile, may be empty
 - utils: source code of utilities (mainly for treecode diagnostics,
             vtk-output etc.)
 - frontends: different applications that utilize the treecode for their
             respective very specific purpose
            
In case you want to use pepc for developing an own treecode-based N-body code,
you might start by copying and modifying the pepc-mini frontend, which is a 
very simple coulomb-MD programme. It uses the coulomb backend, that implements
an expansion of the plummer potential 1/sqrt(r^2+eps^2) up to quadrupole order.

Take care that your frontend-directory is called "pepc-something" with no 
further minus sign ("-") to be automatically recognized in the build system.

If you want to provide an own interaction-specific backend (for using other
multipole orders and/or force laws), just copy and modify the coulomb subdirectory
there. The backends do not have to be registered in some makefile, but are selected 
inside the main makefile by creating a dependency on lippepc.backend_directory_name
instead of libpepc.coulomb. In case you only need to modify the interaction specific
types but not the functions that are dealing with them (for example for adding 
velocity, mass, etc.), take a look at the coulomb-backend. There, this is done for the
pepc-mini frontend, that uses other types than for example pepc-b while still
using the same force expression. See also variable BACKENDTYPE in pepc-mini's 
makefile.include.
