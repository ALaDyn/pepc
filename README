1. COMPILATION

For compiling this program, the machine-dependent compiler 
names and flags have to be set in a definition file called
'makefile.defs' in the root directory.

Several exemplary definitions are available in the subdirectory
./makefiles. For example, an JUGENE you can simply call

"ln -sf ./makefiles/makefile.defs.jugene ./makefile.defs"

from the root directory to create a symbolic link the the 
appropriate definitions. Some makefile.defs contain
comments on correct MPI implementations etc. - do not
forget to take a look there for hints.

After providing the makefile.defs file, you can simply
call 

"make"

to build the pepce frontend into the ./bin/ directory. 
Parallel make (i.e. "make -j") should work.

There are several different frontends available at the moment:

pepcb: Laser/beam-plasma with magnetic fields
pepce: pure electrostatics
       simple molecular dynamics, 
       some diagnostics for energy, performance, vtk output etc.
pepcmini: pure electrostatics
       simple molecular dynamics
       no diagnostics
       minimum requirements to get pepc running
pepcmw: frontend for laser-plasma interaction (experimental)
pepcs: library version for inclusion in ScaFaCoS project

To build an alternative frontend, just call

"make pepcmini"
or
"make pepcmw"

All frontends can be built using 

"make all"

2. RUNNING THE PROGRAM

Create a run directory, and copy the file run.h there.
Then you can run pepc from there, e.g.

"mkdir rundir"
"cp run.h rundir/"
"cd rundir"
"mpirun -np 4 ../bin/pepce ./run.h"

The file run.h contains some user-adjustable parameters which
are explained therein.

If you want to use checkpointing, particle data output and
vtk file creation (see idump_XXX-parameters for details), 
you have to provide two additional directories inside rundir:

,,,
"cd rundir"
"mkdir vtk"
"mkdir "particles"

3. DOCUMENTATION

Rudimentary doxygen documentation is available by calling

"make doc"

from the root directory. A users guide is in preparation.
