Sod shock tests as described in Sod (1978) or Toro (1997).

The _for_sph_frontend files work only with the sph frontend, the _for_grav_sph_frontend files only with the grav_sph frontend due to some incompatible changes.

Tests seem to work (with both frontends and r3553).
Tests for the tests will be provided later.
